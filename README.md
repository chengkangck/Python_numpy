## One, the understanding of NumPy

(1) Definition: NumPy is called [Numerical Python]. It is an open source Python data analysis and scientific computing library. NumPy is the basis for our later learning of Pandas (data analysis), SciPy (scientific computing) and Matplotlib (drawing library)

(2) Features of NumPy: ①The bottom layer of NumPy is implemented in C language, which is fast. ②NumPy provides data structures (ie arrays) with higher access efficiency than Python's built-in data structures. ③Supports a large number of high-dimensional arrays and matrix operations ④Provides a large number of mathematical functions Library

(3) Install Anaconda: Anaconda is an open source Python distribution that contains more than 1,500 scientific packages such as conda and Python and their dependencies.

## Two, one-dimensional array

1. Array characteristics:

(1) Used to store collections of the same type

(2) Each element has an area of the same storage size in memory

2. The data type of the array

(1) The data type of the array-integer
